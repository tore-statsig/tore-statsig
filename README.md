### Howdy ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tore
I love building delightful experiences for developers.  

These days, I'm doing that as an engineering manager at [Statsig](https://statsig.com/), where I've been working on [SDKs and Integrations](https://docs.statsig.com/sdks/getting-started) since Statsig's day one on Feb 17, 2021.

Cheers!
